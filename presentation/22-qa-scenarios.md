# Common Q&A Scenarios

## Q: Can't we just use Playwright selectors?
**A:** Yes for stable UIs, but:
- Selectors break on UI changes
- Requires constant maintenance
- AI vision adapts automatically
- Better for dynamic/changing interfaces

---

## Q: Isn't this slower than traditional automation?
**A:** Yes, but:
- Traditional: Fast but brittle
- Computer Use: Slower but adaptive
- Use case dependent (stability vs speed)

---

## Q: What if AI makes a wrong decision?
**A:** Built-in safeguards:
- Iteration limits prevent loops
- Error handling catches failures
- Next screenshot shows mistake
- AI can self-correct

---

## Q: Does this work with complex web apps?
**A:** Depends on:
- Visual clarity of UI
- Task complexity
- AI model capabilities
- Currently best for clear, structured interfaces
