### How AI Computer Use Works
1. 📸 AI receives screenshot (pixels only)
2. 🤖 AI analyzes visually: "I see a search box at coordinates (372, 331)"
3. 🎯 AI decides: `ComputerCallAction.Click(x: 372, y: 331)`
4. ⚙️ Execute action in browser
5. 📸 New screenshot → repeat

**Key Insight:** AI doesn't know HTML, CSS, or DOM structure - it only sees pixels like you do!
